# Swarm Automated Deployment

The Swarm Deployment tool can be used to provision and configure multi-node Docker clusters in AWS environments. The tool is made up of two Ansible playbooks. The first playbook creates the ASG/LC configuration, deploys the configuration and EC2 instances, kickstarts the Docker swarm initalization script. Each cluster that is launched using the tool has a unique hosts and manager_conf/worker_conf config files. These config files are stored in Bitbcuket and are created automatically when the cluster is launched. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
ansible-playbook site.yml -e "lifecycle=qa cluster=02"
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests
